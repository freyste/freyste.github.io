I bought my second motorcycle, a 1982 Honda CM250C, with nothing but bad intentions to tear it down to the frame and build it back up as cafe’d out bike and try to disguise the cruiser that it really was. 

The Honda CM250C was the precursor to the current Honda CMX250C, also known as the Honda Rebel 250. I am not a fan of the Rebel or cruiser bikes generally, but there is always something appealing about the fixer upper project. Also more specifically it was cheap. I got this bike for a cool $1,200 dollars on a summer break at college while on an internship. 

I wasn’t put off by the home paint job someone had tried - it looked stealthy and cool 

I wasn’t concerned about a few dents in the tank - hey, that’s just the start of some custom knee dents I can put in it. 

I somehow wasn’t even tripped up by the owners noting that it was tough to start on some days. Like cold days I asked? No, just ~some~ days they replied. 

But it ran great in the test run, and I was the perfect candidate for a project bike - low on money, lots of time and optimism.
