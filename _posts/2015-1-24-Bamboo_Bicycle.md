Bamboo is an awesome material. In terms of specific strength and stiffness, a metric of material's property by weight, it performs better than some steels even!

This project was an attempt to make a bike frame using a dead simple technique Iâ€™d been thinking about for a while. I didn't have the resources or time to make a bike jig for a custom frame geometry. So instead I would take a donor frame of an old steel bike and piece by piece replace the steel bars with bamboo replacements. No jig required and original geometry fully preserved.

The basic process was as follows:
1. Find a donor frame
2. Find and cut to length bamboo replacement bars
3. Heat treat the bamboo 
4. Piece by piece cut the steel frame apart and replace with bamboo
6. Epoxy and carbon wrap the joints
7. Finishing work
