I bought my second motorcycle, a 1982 Honda CM250C, with nothing but bad intentions to tear it down to the frame and build it back up as a cafe racer while trying to disguise the cruiser that it really was. 

The Honda CM250C was the precursor to the current Honda CMX250C, also known as the Honda Rebel 250. I am not a fan of the Rebel or cruiser bikes generally, but there is always something appealing about the fixer upper project. Also more specifically it was cheap. I got this bike for a cool $1,200 dollars on my summer break at college while on an internship. 

I wasn’t put off by the home paint job someone had put on it - *it looked stealthy and cool 

I wasn’t concerned about a few dents in the tank - *hey, that’s just the start of some custom knee dents I can put in it 

I somehow wasn’t even tripped up by the owners noting that it was tough to start on some days. *Like cold days I asked? No, just ~some~ days they replied. 

But it ran great in the test run. I'm sure after ample warm-up before I arrived.

I was the perfect candidate for a project bike - low on money with lots of time and optimism

Here's what it looked like at the outset of the project:

Then after a rainy Oregon fall and winter of taking it apart down to the engine and discovering all kinds of fun issues, I finally got the bike back together in the spring and starting up on all days. 

And here's it after teardown and rebuilding:
