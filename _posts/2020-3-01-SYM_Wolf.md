In the Fall of 2018 I was on a minimalist kick and got the idea in my head that my Ducati Scrambler 800cc was just too big for San Francisco. So I went out and found this adorable 2013 SYM Wolf 150cc Classic at a local dealer. It was basically new, the previous owner had bought it, dropped it on a SF hill and decided pretty quick they didn't want it. So I picked it up for $1,500 thinking that it would replace my Ducati.

The other main perk of this bike has been it's capability to convert people over to the world of motorcycles. One of my go to activities when friends are in town is to take them out to a big parking lot and rip around on it. There's a good chance that this will hook them. I maintain that there is not better motorcyle out there to learn on than one of these SYM Wolfie's. They're light, simple, and have just enough power to keep you out of too much trouble. Also, once they're cafe'd out like mine with all the plasti removed you can directly see all the major components, demystifying the motorcyle and making for a good teaching tool.

I had always been planning to tear down and rebuild this motorcycle, but had kept putting it off.
