At any given time I try to have 3 projects going. I've found this is the magic number of projects that's few enough to be able to make incremental progress on each while not being so few that I can't trade off between them for breaks. 

These three projects are selected at random from my overgrowing list of things I'd like to do. 

The three projects I am currently working on as decided by the Wheel Decide wheel are: 

- Build a compost system

- Put on 20 lbs of muscle

- Learn how to tell the hour of the night by the stars 

Stay tuned for updates on these projects...
