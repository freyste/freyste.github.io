summary: Another Christmas gift project for my nephews

I may have set a dangerous precedent as the Uncle that builds cool things for his nephews, a precedent that always needs to be one-upped... So this year I attempted to make replicas of the jetpacks from the Star Wars show Mandalorian. If I were a kid watching this show - this would definitely be the piece of tech that I would be wanting to be real.

Just look at how fun they look!

And I couldn't make just 1, I needed to make a jetpack for each nephew. Luckily there are 2 badass jetpacks in this seasons show. Din Djarin how wears a pack made of the near indestructible beskar, and Boba Fett with a well work JT-12 pack.

So let's get started!

With a ply wood base and then just build up shapes around it using a combination of foam board and 3D printed parts.

It was basically a guess and check method using photos as a point of reference.

And slowly they started to take shape.

With gaffing tape to fill awkward gaps..

And maybe a bit too much epoxy used...

Here's the final strucure before the finishing paint touches shown at the top. Not shown are the backpack straps I added as well as red LED in the rockets with big analog tactile switched to turn them on.
