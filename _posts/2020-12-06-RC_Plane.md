Some day I will pilot a plane, but for this year I am only making baby steps toward that goal. The first baby step was to learn to fly an RC plane to understand more about the fundamentals of how planes fly. Basically I wanted to come out of it with a more tangible feeling of plane control surfaces and the motions they effedct.

I spent a few weeks practicing on the aerofly RC 7 simulator leading up to my first flight and while I waited for the plane to arrive.

The plane I picked was a very cheap (assuming I might crash it right out of the gate) 400mm wingspan 2.4G 6-Axis gyro Mini Mustang P-51D. The 6-axis gyro would allow me to ease into flying with beginner modes in which wind effect could be lessened and you wouldn't be punished as badly for making sudden movements.

I was even able to land the plane in a passable way.
