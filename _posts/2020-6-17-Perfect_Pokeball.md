My nephews have a new obsession, Pokémon. I took it on as a project to make them some Pokéballs they could play with around the yard. They've been making Pokémon videos so I thought this would be a pretty cool prop for them.

I knew that any Pokéball I made for them was going to take a beating as they would inevitably throw it and probably not always onto soft surfaces. 
With that in mind, initially the idea was just to make a a super strong, heavy, simple ball that could take a beating.

They turned out alright, loved the weight of them, but they didn't really have the magic feel of a Pokéball because there wasnt a hinge opening action. So I started to think about how to redesign it.

I came up with a short list of requirements for the perfect Pokéball toy:

- Push button to open
- Hinges that force the lid closed but also keep it in a opened position (like a double hinge on a door)
- Satisfying magnetic snap closure 
- Heavy, has to feel real and not cheap
- Throwable, has to be a very robust design to drop/shock events

While sitting and thinking about the hinge problem i realized the solution was literally in my hands. The Airpods case I was holding had the exact feel and spring mechanism I was looking for in a Pokéball. 
Fortunately the Airpods hinge patent is availble so I did not have to break mine open to take a look. The design uses a torsional springs
and two cams so that the hinge takes force to open but then at around 45 degrees after opening begins to push the other way so that the hinge keeps itself open.
In additon to that there are embedded magnets that give the closing action a satisfying snap.

I designed a handful of different cam prototypes changing up various dimensions, printed them all out, and began to try to find the one that has the perfect hinge feel.

This is a work in progress project. Stay tuned as I work out how to integrate the hinge into the design...
