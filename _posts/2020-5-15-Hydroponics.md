title: Roots on the Roof
summary: Making a rooftop ebb and flow hydroponics system
---

Like many others, Iâ€™ve been inspired to start a vegetable garden over the quarantine period with all this extra time and cooking at home. Our house in San Francisco unfortunately does not have much of a yard for planting, so our best option was to plant on our roof. The concept was a hydroponics system that would require minimal maintenance and trips onto the roof with the exception of when we are harvesting our crops.

After some initial brainstorming and research an ebb and flow style of hydroponics system was our best bet as its a relatively passive system that fill up the plant reservoirs and then drains slowly throughout the day. This means that the pumps the pumps only need to be operating for a few minutes a day saving big on electricity costs.

 A trip to Home Depot later we had set up a small prototype system to work out the bugs.

In our prototype setup we discovered a few problems that would need addressing. The major one was that if we had multiple reservoirs in series we would need to be able to control how the long ebb and flow process took, or how quickly each plant rerservoir would flow into the next.

Once satisfied that we had found all of the hard problems with our prototype we were ready to scale up the design and install them onto the roof.

The working principle of the system is 

The system has one large reservoir of water that we keep on the deck with at a different times throughout the day will be pumped to the roof to replenish the reservoirs.

There were a number of parts that required design and fabrication like the silicone foam sealed end caps. These encaps were a critical improvement when we realized its a huge advantage to have a remove-able end cap for cleaning and maintenance.

Another part designed were the dams that allow the ebb and flow process to take place as water can build up and then slowly empty thought the day.

Lastly is the side clips and wind covering that we found were necessary with the 20-30 mph winds we get over our house every day.
