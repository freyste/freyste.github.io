Meaningful gift giving is hard and this year for Christmas I'd wanted to pull it off and make my sisters something that might actually be worth keeping

I decided on jewelry that would be based on some of the designs my grandfather had used in his wood carvings. Step 1 was to convert some of the photos I had of these designs, which were used to transfer his carvings to wood, into digital vector line files.

The process was pretty tedious but was aided with the use of an iPad were i could closely follow the curves and edit as needed.

After that I picked the one I was happiest with and moved it into a FreeCAD to form the 3D model.

At this point I decided to skip casting them in metal myself and opt to have Shapeways do it. My understanding of the process is that they print your design in wax, then using a lost wax molding process are able to cast it in your metal of choice.

In the future I plan to build a simple furnace-crucible setup but am currenty limited by space that would be safe for playing with molten metals...

I opted for it to be cast in silver with on light polishing for a more natural look.

Overall it turned out pretty well. Therw are however obvious tells that it was produced in with a 3D printer such as the lines in the recessed areas that could not easitly by polished out.

Also ended up making stickers out of the digital design that didnt make the cut for being made into jewelry.
