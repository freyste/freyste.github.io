I’ve always been drawn to the idea that bamboo wood has sufficient natural material properties to perform the same tasks as a metal or carbon composite. In terms of specific strength which is a metric of materials strength by weight, it performs better than some steels even.

This project was an attempt to make a dead simple frame building technique I’d been thinking about for a while that would still result in a very cool end result. The idea was that I didn't have the resources or time to make a bike jig for a custom frame geometry. So instead I would take a donor frame of an old steel bike and piece by piece replace the steel bars with bamboo replacements. No jig required and original geometry fully preserved.

The basic process was as follows:
1. Find a donor frame
2. Find and cur to length bamboo replacement bars
3. Heat treat the bamboo 
4. Piece by piece cut the steel frame apart and replace with bamboo
6. Epoxy and carbon wrap the joints
7. Finishing work
