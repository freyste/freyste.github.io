In the Fall of 2018 I was on a minimalist kick and got the idea in my head that my Ducati Scrambler 800cc was unnecessarily big for San Francisco. So I went out and found this adorable 2013 SYM Wolf 150cc Classic at a local dealer. It was basically new with 200 miles on it. According to the shop the previous owner had bought it new, dropped it on a SF hill and decided pretty quick they didn't want it. So I picked it up for $1,500 thinking that I could downsize and it would replace my Ducati...

So what is a SYM Wolf 150cc Classic? SYM Motors is a Taiwanese company and before selling it's own motorcycles was contract manufacturer for Honda starting in 1961. At some point the company started to produce their own bikes which by 2002 were in direct competition with Honda bikes, and the CM deal was terminated. So with that history the SYM Wolf has some interesting early Honda CB200 clones vibes going on. 

Despite its or maybe because of its dead simple design straight out of the 1980s these SYM wolfies have a pretty dedicated micro-cult following.

I had always been planning to tear down and rebuild this motorcycle, but had kept putting it off.

Here's the teardown process:

Here's the final result:

It has in fact been a great around town motorcyle but it has not served it's original purpose of replacing the Ducati. It's also been the perfect starter motorcycle for friends interested in dipping a toe into motorcycles. It's light, simple, and has just enough power to keep you out of too much trouble. Also, once they're cafe'd out like this one with all the plastic removed you can directly see all the major components, demystifying the motorcyle and making for a good teaching tool.
