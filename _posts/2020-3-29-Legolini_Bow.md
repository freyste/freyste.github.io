Taking the trophy for the coolest thing you can make on a 3D printer at the moment is the Legolini. It's a repeating crossbow with an ingenious design that not only is fun to make but also to use. I've been using it in the backyard as a mini activity during quaratine and highly recommend it.

<!-- Import the component -->
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer-legacy.js"></script>

<!-- Use it like any other HTML element -->
<model-viewer src="/images/Combined3Dbow.glb" style="width:500px; height:500px;" auto-rotate camera-controls camera-orbit="180deg 30deg 105%"></model-viewer>

Here's the crazy part, this little design can have up to a 30 lb draw weight, a launch speed of 95.5 miles per hour, and can fire off bolts and 40 per minute.

Technically it does not fit the definition of a crossbow. It's a bow because it can't be locked in cocked condition and store energy. Like a bow it must be held in its draw position with force and release with a trigger much like a traditional bow with a modern release. It's really a slingbow, which does allow it to live outside of some of the regulations associated with crossbows.
