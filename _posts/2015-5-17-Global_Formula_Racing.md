GFR was my first experience being involved with a engineering project that was so cool that I was fully willing to pull regular all nighters to contribute to it. We were a team of engineering students building a race car and it its a feeling I’ve been pursuing in my career ever since. 

GFR or Global Formula Racing is an international cooperation between the BA Racing Team from Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg-Ravensburg (DHBW), Germany, and the Beaver Racing Team from Oregon State University (OSU), USA.
