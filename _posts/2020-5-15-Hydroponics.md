title: Roots on the Roof
summary: Making a rooftop ebb and flow hydroponics system
---

Like many others, Iâ€™ve been inspired to start a vegetable garden over the quarantine period with all this extra time and cooking at home. Our house in San Francisco unfortunately does not have much of a yard for planting, so our best option was to plant on our roof. The concept was a hydroponics system that would require minimal maintenance and trips onto the roof with the exception of when we are harvesting our crops.

After some initial brainstorming and research, an ebb and flow style hydroponics system was our best option as its a relatively passive system that fills up the plant reservoirs and then drains slowly throughout the day. This means that the water pumps only need to be operating for a few minutes a day which saves big on electricity costs.

 A trip to Home Depot later we had set up a small prototype system to work out the bugs.

In our prototype setup we discovered a few problems that would need addressing. The major one was that if we had multiple reservoirs in series we would need to be able to control how the long ebb and flow process took, or how quickly each plant rerservoir would flow into the next.

Once satisfied that we had found all of the hard problems with our prototype we were ready to scale up the design and install them onto the roof.

There were a number of parts that required design and fabrication like the silicone foam sealed end caps. These snap on end caps were a critical improvement when we realized its a huge advantage to have a remove-able end cap for cleaning and maintenance. Before the end caps are installed, an end cap block is first epoxied to the reservoir which prived the compression to the silicone foam seal once snapped in place.

Another part designed were the dams that allow the ebb and flow process to take place as water can build up and then slowly empty thought the day. The dams have holes drilled into them such that water can leak out at a controlled rate. It was a bit of a trial an error process to establish just how many holes were needed to get the desired outflow rates between the reservoirs.

Lastly is the side clips and wind covering that we found were necessary with the 20-30 mph winds we get over our house every day. Attached to these clips are chicken-wire domes which can be coated with seran wrap to prevent young seedling from being damaged by the wind.
