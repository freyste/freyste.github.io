Meaningful gift giving is hard and this year for Christmas I'd wanted to pull it off and make my sisters something that might actually be worth keeping

I decided on jewelry that would be based on some of the designs my grandfather had used in his wood carvings. Step 1 was to convert some of the photos I had of these designs, which were what he used to start his carving into a digital vector line file.

The process was pretty tedious but was aided with the use of an iPad were i could closely follow the curved and edit as needed.

After that I picked the one I was happiest with and moved it into a FreeCAD to form the 3D model.

At this point I decided to skip casting them in metal myself and opt to have Shapeways do it. My understanding of the process is that they print your design in wax, then using a lost wax molding process are able to cast it in your metal of choice.

I opted for silver.

Overall it turned out pretty well, with a surface that was rougher in areas that couldn't be polished.

I ended up making stickers out of the digital design that didnt make the cut for being made into jewelry.
