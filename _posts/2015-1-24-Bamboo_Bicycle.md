I've always wanted to make a bike frame but have never had the resources available weld a steel/aluminum frame at home and would never dare trying to do carbon fiber layup for a structural parts with a home vacuum and kitchen oven. There is still, however one frame material and a technique that I think I can pull off...  This project was an attempt to make a bamboo bike frame using a dead simple technique I’d been thinking about for a while. 

The first step was to pick a frame geometry, which usually would involve designing a frame jig to establish it's geometry. Building a bike jig for a custom frame geometry is doable but not entirely necessary. As an alterative I opted for a technique where I would take a steel donor frame with a gemetry I liked and piece by piece replace the steel tubes with bamboo replacement tubes. No jig required and original geometry fully preserved.

With that technique the basic process was as follows:
1. Find a donor frame, remove tubes 1 by one wuth a saw and cut to length bamboo replacement bars

2. Epoxy and carbon wrap the joints

Bamboo is an awesome material with a tensile strength comparable to steel but needing 50x less energy to produce. In terms of specific tensile strength, a metric of bamboo’s strength by weight, it can be 6x higher than most structural steels!
