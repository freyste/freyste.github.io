I've always wanted to make a bike frame but have never had the resources available weld a steel/aluminum frame at home and would never dare trying to do carbon fiber layup for a structural parts with a home vacuum and kitchen oven. There is still, however one frame material and a technique that I think I can pull off...  This project was an attempt to make a bamboo bike frame using a dead simple technique Iâ€™d been thinking about for a while. 

Building a bike jig for a custom frame geometry is doable but not entirely necessary. As an alterative I opted for a technique where I would take a steel donor frame with a gemetry I liked and piece by piece replace the steel bars with bamboo replacements. No jig required and original geometry fully preserved.

The basic process was as follows:
1. Find a donor frame
2. Find and cut to length bamboo replacement bars
3. Heat treat the bamboo 
4. Piece by piece cut the steel frame apart and replace with bamboo
6. Epoxy and carbon wrap the joints
7. Finishing work
