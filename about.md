I'm a Mechanical engineer living in San Francisco with 5 years of experience in consumer electronics hardware specializing in mechanical design, reliability analysis, and process engineering. A curiosity for both the development and field life of products is reflected in my diverse experience across R&D prototyping, through the engineering design process, and all the way to product reliability and field performance analysis. Skilled in CAD, reliability analysis, prototyping, and machining with a foundation in engineering mechanics and materials selection - I'm always up for a interesting and impactful engineering challenge.

Outside of my work I'm usually doing some pretty interesting projects, which I do my best to share here. If you have questions or comments about my projects or anything else, feel free to reach out.
