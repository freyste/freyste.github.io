title: The Bamboo Bicycle 
summary: A dead simple technique for building a bicycle out of bamboo
---


 
I've always wanted to make a bike frame but have never had the resources available weld a steel/aluminum frame at home and 
would never dare trying to do carbon fiber layup for a structural part with a home vacuum and kitchen oven. There is still, however, one frame material and a technique that I think I can pull off...  This project was an attempt to make a bamboo bike frame using a dead simple technique I’d been thinking about for a while. 

The first step was to pick a frame geometry, which usually would involve designing a frame jig to establish it's geometry. Building a bike jig for a custom frame geometry is very doable but not entirely necessary. As an alterative I opted to take a steel donor frame with a gemetry I liked and piece by piece replace the steel tubes with bamboo replacement tubes. No jig required and original geometry fully preserved.

With the donor frame I began to remove tubes one by one with a saw and cut to length bamboo replacement bars.

After each tube was replaced the steel and bamboo frames were attached using carbon fiber tow and epoxy

Results turned out great and the bike has been riding well for the past 3 months! Lookign forward to making more structures out of bamboo in the future. It's is an awesome material with a tensile strength comparable to steel but needing 50x less energy to produce. In terms of specific tensile strength, a metric of bamboo’s strength by weight, it can be 6x higher than most structural steels!
