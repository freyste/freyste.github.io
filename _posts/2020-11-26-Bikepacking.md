This dumpster-fire of a year opened up a unique opportunity to check a adventure off my list that I've been looking at for about a year now. The plan was to bike from San Francisco to Santa Cruz, taking 3 days and 2 nights to do it. 

Here's the gear I packed along for the ride.

And for the curious here is the route I planned and stayed, for the most part, true to.

Day 1

Day 1 starts by getting out of the city.

Then after going over the hill the trail drops you into Pacifica before passing by Mavericks.

After getting into Half-Moon Bay I was feeling pretty bonked from the sun and stopped to get a beer and truffle fries at Half Moon Brewing.

I ended the day camping at Francis Beach Park using one of their walk up hike/bike spots.

It's a great camping spot that is mostly book year-round and filled with RVs. The ocean views, quiet beach, and sunsets were great. I enjoyed a solo dehydrated meal while watching a great sunset.

I also managed to find what may be THE picture of the year for me:

Along the way I saw some lost souls..

Along the way I got groceries...

Day 3

And finally Day 3

The finish was the best part of the ride. Not as much becuase the ride was over but that I had friends to share it with. The friends i would be staying with for the night gave me a champage finish line which was the coolest thing one could hope for.
